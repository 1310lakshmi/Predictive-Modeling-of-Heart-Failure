# Predictive-Modeling-of-Heart-Failure
Heart Failure Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle (Fedoriano, 2021). We utilized various classification models to achieve this objective.

# Overview
The theoretical section of the project includes the introduction and literature review. The introduction outlines the classification models employed for predicting heart failure, while the literature review provides insights into related research works. We compared our project's methods and results with existing literature.

# Implementation
Data Analysis and Pre-processing:

Conducted thorough data analysis, visualization, and pre-processing to prepare the dataset for model training.


# Classification Models:

Trained and compared several classification models, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
K Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluated performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Ensemble Models:

Explored various ensemble models, including:
Random Forest Classifier
Bagging
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Assessed model performance and compared results.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tuned hyperparameters of the best-performing models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting) using GridSearchCV.
Reported model accuracy on test data.

# Results
Our analysis concludes that Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting Algorithm are the top-performing models, achieving an accuracy of 89.13 percent.
